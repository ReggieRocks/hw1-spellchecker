## Brief Summary 
This program checks the spelling of words in a text file using a dictionary-based data structure.

The program uses three input files:
- A dictionary file containing correctly spelled words
- A text file to be checked for spelling errors
- An output file that displays the internal structure of the dictionary

First, the program reads the dictionary file and stores all words in a `Dictionary` data structure. All words are converted to lowercase, and duplicate words are ignored.

Next, the program reads the text file line by line. Each word is cleaned, converted to lowercase, and checked against the dictionary. If a word is not found, it is reported as a misspelling.

For each misspelled word, the program prints the word and the line number where it appears. Possible spelling corrections are also printed when available.

Possible corrections are generated by:
- Adding one letter
- Removing one letter
- Swapping two neighboring letters

All spelling results are printed to the terminal, and the final dictionary structure is written to the output file.

Part 2 demonstrates the difference between an AVL binary search tree and a regular binary search tree.  An AVL tree automatically balances its left and right subtrees, keeping searches efficient. A regular binary search tree does not rebalance itself, which can lead to slower searches if the tree becomes unbalanced.

Part 3 replaces the Dictionary’s AVL tree with a hash table using double hashing, while keeping the same public interface. The table rehashes when it exceeds 50% capacity and is implemented as a dynamically managed array. Dictionary contents can be printed by table index or in sorted order for verification and comparison.

Dictionary Implementations by Program Part
Part 1: Dictionary.h / Dictionary.cpp — Binary Search Tree
Part 2: AVL_Dictionary.h / AVL_Dictionary.cpp — AVL Self-Balancing Tree
Part 3: Hash_Dictionary.h / Hash_Dictionary.cpp — Hash Table with Double Hashing

## A hard-copy of the direct output of your program 
You can use Unix’s redirecting commands to redirect the output to some text files and print out the files. I will compare this hard copy with the actual outputs of your programs. They have to be consistent.

(optional, only when you want me to check and remark your program.)
